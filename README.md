# Project2

###THE BEST DAMN VIDEO GAME SITE ON THE INTERNET###

#The purpose of this project was to create an app / site that gives you a list of recommended video games from a survey of questions. Then it should bring up a list of recommended games, based on our suggested genre.  Then when you click on the poster of the games a video pops up (say from Youtube) for a trailer to the game. Then there would be be a favorites list if you make an account and log in so you can have your own personal "wishlist". Also game price would be a good thing to add under all of the posters so users can budget. We'd use api's, handlebars, and could also deploy it to Heroku uses mySQl and sequelize.
